# derpachu.github.io

this is creating a version 2 of the website that was previously done for a class for fall semester 2016.

the scope of this new website is to fix all the flex box issues in the previous version as well as updating content.

the goal is to make a presentable site that I can publish as well as assemble a protfolio to employers.
